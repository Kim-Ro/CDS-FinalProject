**Project title:** The recognition of digitalization as a driver for climate change in EU politics

**Project description:** In this project the recognition of digitalization as a driver for climate change in EU politics is analyzed by comparing how much it is mentioned in recent Eu publications to it's calculated impact of 4.2%. To achieve a representation of the current recognition, the 100 most recent Eu publications on the topic of the environment will be scraped from the website of the EU publications office. Text mining for a digitalization related vocabulary combined with a sentiment analysis will determine how much recognition of digitalization there is in the current climate debate.
